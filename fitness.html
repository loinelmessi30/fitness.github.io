        <h1>WHAT IS FITNESS ?</h1>


        <p>"Fitness" is a broad term that means something different to each person, but it refers to your own optimal
                health and overall well-being. Being fit not only means physical health, but emotional and mental
                health, too. It defines every aspect of your health. Smart eating and active living are fundamental to
                fitness.</P>
        <div>
                <H3>According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Complete Food and Nutrition Guide (3rd ed.),
                        when you are fit, you have:</H3>
        </div>
        <ul>
                <li>Energy to do what's important to you and to be more productive</li>
                <li>Stamina and a positive outlook to handle the mental challenges and emotional ups and downs of
                        everyday life and to deal with stress</li>
                <li>Reduced risk for many health problems, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis</li>
                <li>The chance to look and feel your best</li>
                <li>Physical strength and endurance to accomplish physical challenges</li>
                <li>A better chance for a higher quality of life and perhaps a longer life, too</li>
        </ul>

        <P>Studies have shown that physical activity can improve mental health and well-being. This improvement is due
                to an increase in blood flow to the brain, allowing for the release of hormones as well as a decrease
                stress hormones in the body (e.g., cortisol, adrenaline) while also stimulating the human body's mood
                boosters and natural painkillers. Not only does exercise release these feel-good hormones, it can also
                help relieve stress and help build confidence.The same way exercising can help humans to have a
                healthier life, it also can improve sleep quality. Based on studies, even 10 minutes of exercise per day
                can help insomnia.These trends improve as physical activity is performed on a consistent basis, which
                makes exercise effective in relieving symptoms of depression and anxiety, positively impacting mental
                health and bringing about several other benefits. For example:</P>
        <ul>
                <li>Physical activity has been linked to the alleviation of depression and anxiety symptoms.</li>
                <li>In patients with schizophrenia, physical fitness has been shown to improve their quality of life and
                        decrease the effects of schizophrenia.</li>
                <li>Being fit can improve one's self-esteem.</li>
                <li>Working out can improve one's mental alertness and it can reduce fatigue.</li>
                <li>Increased opportunity for social interaction, allowing for improved social skills</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
                <h3>To achieve some of these benefits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests at least
                        30 or 60 minutes of exercise 3-5 times a week.</h3>
        </div>
        <ul>
                <li>Different forms of exercise have been proven to improve mental health and reduce the risk of
                        depression, anxiety, and suicide.</li>
                <li>Benefits of Exercise on Mental health include ... Improved sleep, Stress relief, Improvement in
                        mood, Increased energy and stamina, Reduced tiredness that can increase mental alertness. There

                </div>
                <P>Your heart is a muscle and needs frequent exercise to help it keep fit and healthy. A healthy heart
                        can pump blood efficiently around your body. Your heart will improve in performance when it is
                        regularly challenged with exercise. Stronger hearts can improve overall health of the body.</P>

                </DIv>
                <P>Regular sport causes more oxygen to be drawn into the body with carbon monoxide and waste gases
                        expelled. This increases the lung capacity during sport, improving lung function and efficiency.

                <P>As well as the physical and mental benefits, sport also offers some incredible social benefits too.

                        Taking part in group sports can improve relationships between players and helps individuals to
                        improve their teamwork, communication and problem-solving skills.

                        Organised sport also helps to improve discipline and can boost self-motivation too, by making us
                        feel like we are part of a collective and that we are contributing towards that.</P>

        <ul>
                <li>proteins</li>
                <p>Proteins give your body amino acids — the building blocks that help your body's cells do all of their
                        everyday activities. Proteins help your body build new cells, repair old cells, create hormones
                        and enzymes, and keep your immune system healthy. If you don't have enough protein, your body
                        takes longer to recover from illness and you're more likely to get sick in the first place.</p>
                <li>Carbohydrates</li>
                <p>Carbohydrates give you quick energy — they quickly go into your blood as glucose (blood sugar), which
                        your body uses for fuel first, before turning the leftovers into fat.

                        Fruits, vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, cereal products, crackers, dried beans, peas, and
                        lentils are all good sources of carbohydrates. Many of them are also good sources of fiber,
                        which your digestive system needs to stay healthy.</p>
                <li>Vitamins and minerals</li>
                <P>Vitamins keep your bones strong, your vision clear and sharp, and your skin, nails, and hair healthy
                        and glowing. Vitamins also help your body use energy from the food you eat.

                        Minerals are chemical elements that help regulate your body's processes. Potassium, for example,
                        helps your nerves and muscles function. Calcium helps your teeth and bones stay strong. Iron
                        carries oxygen to your cells.</P>
                <LI>Water</LI>
                <P>Water is necessary for life, which makes it vital for good health. Water makes up about 50% to 66% of
                        your total body weight. It regulates your temperature, moves nutrients through your body, and
                        gets rid of waste. Breast cancer treatment can sometimes cause diarrhea or vomiting. Losing a
                        lot of fluids plus the chemicals and minerals they contain can lead to dehydration.</P>
